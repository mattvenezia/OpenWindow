# OpenWindow

### Inspiration
This project was inspired by my need to know when the weather is below 69 degrees so I can be informed when I should open my window and save on my electric bill.

### Overview
Using OpenWeather API to pull weather data for a user-specified location.


### Dependencies
- `requests` via https://pypi.org/project/requests
- if you don't have it -> `pip install requests`
- an API key from https://openweathermap.org/
- it should be free
